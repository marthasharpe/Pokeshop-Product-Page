# Pokeshop Product Page

### A mock product landing page for new Pokemon trainers.

This project was for the Responsive Web Design Certification through freeCodeCamp.  
I created a navbar, an embedded video, several clickable product tiles, and an email submission form.  
This is a mock-up using only HTML and CSS.
